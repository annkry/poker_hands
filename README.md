# poker_hands
I will consider a variant of poker in which:
There is no drawing, players choose random 5 cards and compare the strength of their hands.
One of the players, the Player2, draws 5 cards from a deck containing only aces, kings, queens, and jacks.
The other player, the Player1, draws 5 cards from a deck containing only deuces, treys, ..., tens.
A program will estimate the chance of Player1's victory in a showdown with Player2."

To run: python main.py
